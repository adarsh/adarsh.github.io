<p>I have been a consultant for ten years
in one capacity or another.
I&rsquo;ve been a technology consultant for three years
and sold development services
for most of that time.</p>

<p>These days, I&rsquo;m a freelance developer
writing Ruby and JavaScript
and helping set up good development routines
to help teams be super productive and happy.</p>

<p>Frequently, I get asked for advice
on how to build a consulting business.
Usually the people asking are
developers just starting out.</p>

<p>When I share whatever I know,
I usually ask the other person to keep me posted
on how things turn out.
I&rsquo;m always curious to know
if anything I&rsquo;ve said was actually useful
so I can stop boring people if when it&rsquo;s not.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I spoke with someone
starting a software consulting business with his friend.</p>

<p>Some months after we spoke,
he wrote to let me know
things were going well
and they&rsquo;d landed some clients.
(I very rarely ever hear back from people later,
so this was awesome for me!)
Apparently, some of what I said was useful
and fortunately for me,
he took notes and shared them back with me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to turn these notes into
a few posts summarizing things I say a lot
in hopes it helps someone out.</p>

<p>More importantly,
I&rsquo;m hoping sharing whatever I know
can turn &ldquo;sales&rdquo; from
something slimy and manipulative
into clear and honest tactics
for growing a small business.</p>
