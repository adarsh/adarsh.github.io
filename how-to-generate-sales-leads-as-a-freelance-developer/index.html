<p>As I wrote in <a href="/how-to-run-a-freelance-software-consulting-business">this post</a>,
I&rsquo;m sharing what I know about
consulting in the hope it&rsquo;s helpful for others.</p>

<p>This post focuses on how to generate sales leads or
&ldquo;finding people who are interested in paying you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everything here I learned as a freelance
management consultant,
while selling millions of dollars of work
for a medium-sized boutique firm,
and now as a freelance developer.</p>

<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s a weird thing to hire someone else
and pay them for their time.</p>

<p>The relationship requires trust above all else.
Once one party loses trust in the other,
it&rsquo;s best to move on, re-evaluate what happened,
and find other work.
As such everything you do
needs to be authentic, honest, and professional,
including trying to drum up business.</p>

<p>Also it&rsquo;s worth noting these tactics work best
when you do them very consistently
for a long time.
There&rsquo;s no substitute for building good routines
and doing the work.</p>

<p>Finally, it should be noted
that I am by no means perfect at sales
and your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>Okay let&rsquo;s start:</p>

<h2>Networking</h2>

<h3>Specific Tactics I Use</h3>

<ul>
<li>Keep a list of people to stay in touch with.</li>
<li>Be sure to follow up regularly. Use tools to automate the process.
I like to send a reminder to <a href="http://help.followup.cc/knowledge_base/topics/cheat-sheet"><code>every2months@followup.cc</code></a> with
the subject line &ldquo;Get Coffee With PERSON&rdquo; and get reminded regularly.
Repeating calendar invites are great for this as well.</li>
<li>Be Helpful 1: Make introductions on behalf of people you think might
benefit from meeting each other.</li>
<li>Be Helpful 2: Forward articles/videos/tweets/etc to people if you think
they&rsquo;ll find it interesting / relevant.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t spend time with people you don&rsquo;t like.</li>
<li>Send them articles when you think they may find them interesting. <a href="/google-reader-as-a-networking-tool">Here&rsquo;s an
old post where I talk about doing it with Google Reader</a>, which
tells you how old the post is.</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal of these activities
is to make &ldquo;business friends&rdquo;
whom you like, and who like you.
If you don&rsquo;t like someone,
or are just hanging out with them
because you feel you have to,
it won&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>You should be helpful to them,
recommending candidates to hire,
articles to read,
people to meet,
and services to try.</p>

<p>You should ask them for advice frequently.
You should ask them for help rarely.
You should support their businesses,
retweet their product announcements,
and support their crowdfunding campaigns,
<em>but only do so because you feel like it</em>.</p>

<p>I should note
that every job I&rsquo;ve ever gotten
has been a result of networking.
I&rsquo;m guessing this is broadly true.</p>

<h3>Why Do This</h3>

<p>First of all,
you make business friends to learn.
Asking questions helps you understand
what other companies and situations are like
which helps you handle your own thing.</p>

<p>Second of all, it feels good to help people,
or rather it should.
If it doesn&rsquo;t,
there&rsquo;s a whole other set of problems to address.</p>

<p>But really,
the reason you get to know a lot of people
is to be top of mind when they need help.</p>

<p>An example is:
Sally works at a company
and hears
&ldquo;oh we need to get help with this Rails app,&rdquo;
and thinks
&ldquo;I wonder if my friend YOUR_NAME knows someone, or can help&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they call you,
and you have a discussion about how helpful you can be
(if at all).
Be sure to let them know
if you&rsquo;re the wrong person for the job
but maybe you know who the right person is.</p>

<p>All of this should feel authentic.
If it feels slimy or manipulative to you,
it will seem that way to everyone,
and you won&rsquo;t build trust (see above).</p>

<h2>Content Marketing: Writing</h2>

<h3>Specific Tactics I Use</h3>

<ul>
<li>Set up a blog which clearly states you are hirable and what skills you have.</li>
<li>Blog and tweet as regularly as you can about your work.
The content should be solid, but quantity and regularity matter much more.</li>
<li>If you do something neat for a client, use their name (with permission).
They may cross-promote your post for you.</li>
<li>Try using an editorial board in Trello to build a pipeline of ideas
which you can push along into posts.</li>
<li>Set regular writing goals like one post per week, one hour a day, etc.</li>
<li>Promote your posts using Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Facebook, whatever.
You can use <a href="https://buffer.com">Buffer</a> to automate this stuff.</li>
<li>Find a pal who is good at writing to edit your posts before going out.
I have everything in GitHub and ask for reviews using pull requests.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Do This</h3>

<p>Writing blog posts is the highest leverage activity you can engage in.
In other words,
you can reach the most people
per unit time of effort.</p>

<p>Also, posts last forever
and the longer they&rsquo;re around
the more likely they are to be read.</p>

<p>Finally, your writing is representative of
what you are like to work with.
If it&rsquo;s clear and well-edited,
it&rsquo;ll signal how you take care in your work.
If you share interesting perspectives,
it likely means you&rsquo;ll have valuable things to say
when someone hires you.
If you write very regularly,
it clearly demonstrates discipline.</p>

<h2>Content Marketing: Speaking</h2>

<h3>Specific Tactics I Use</h3>

<ul>
<li>Write a ton of articles. Seriously, as many as you can.</li>
<li>Some of them will get a lot of traction. You&rsquo;ll know because people will
tweet them and maybe contact you. Analytics could help here also.</li>
<li>Write a 5-10 minute talk about the most popular topic.</li>
<li>Ask to give that talk at a meetup. Organizers are always looking for
good technical material as long as you&rsquo;re not shamelessly selling something.</li>
<li>Big meetups record or stream the video content.  Watch the recording to
see how you did. Also ask others at the meeting for feedback.</li>
<li>Keep giving this talk. In other words, practice.</li>
<li>Expand the talk to something bigger.</li>
<li>Use the expanded talk and video as submission materials for conferences.</li>
<li>Go to conferences and meet all the other nice people.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Do This</h3>

<p>Talks help promote your articles, which in turn promote your consulting business.</p>

<p>In addition, speaking publicly makes you seem approachable and gives shy people
a great excuse to talk to you, which is the goal - networking and making
friends in your field of work.</p>

<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s a lot of fun.</p>

<h2>Then What?</h2>

<p>How do you handle all of this crazy sales demand
now that you are a big shot?</p>

<p>People will find a way to get in touch with you.
You could add an interest form to your blog
to increase the volume,
but note that comes with a decrease in quality.</p>

<p>You may need something like a CRM
if you&rsquo;re going to run a firm
with other people as employees.</p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s just you, don&rsquo;t bother.
Use something like Trello to keep info in one place,
and follow-up regularly with interested parties.</p>

<p>My next post will be on how to actually close these leads.</p>
