Continuing with the early 90's theme, I pulled this classic out of the memories for today's SOTD. Fishbone are a pretty interesting band, playing reggae/ska and hardcore, but also because the members of the band are clearly insane. During the release and subsequent touring of their classic album ["Give a Monkey a Brain and He'll Swear He's the Center of the Universe](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000028PD/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&tag=whmomyth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0000028PD)", this happened:


Just before Fishbone joined the 1993 Lollapalooza tour, guitarist Kendall Jones, reportedly suffering from mental instability, quit the band; [John Norwood Fisher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Norwood_Fisher) tracked him down and after an attempt to help him was charged with kidnapping.[[6]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbone#cite_note-5) A benefit concert to help with Norwood's legal expenses featured Porno for Pyros, Primus, Tool, and Alice in Chains.[3] Fishbone was then dropped by Sony Records. Around this time, Keyboardist Christopher Dowd left Fishbone and recorded with a band including Jeff Buckley under the name Seedy Arkhestra, releasing the album _The Puzzle_, which included the anti-Fishbone track "Flog Your Dead Horse." (From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbone))


I saw the 1993 Lollapalooza performance in Milan, MI after my buddy Dave's 1970 Oldsmobile Rocket gave up the ghost in a McDonald's parking lot for 5 hours in 100+ degree heat. We finally got the car running, celebrated like maniacs, and were faced with a moral quandry - drive this piece of junk to the show and risk getting stuck overnight or drive home and get a more reliable car. We did the latter and caught Fishbone screaming at the audience and putting on an amazing show. I have since never eaten at McDonald's.

This album is pretty complex - you would call it a "concept" record if you thought these guys had such lofty ideas. In any case, it's amazing and well worth picking up and includes "Unyielding Conditioning", a super-upbeat song about really depressing topics (much in the vein of [The Doors "Peace Frog"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X34JarNjoIU)).

Buy "[Give a Monkey a Brain and He'll Swear He's the Center of the Universe](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000028PD/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&tag=whmomyth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0000028PD)" from Amazon
