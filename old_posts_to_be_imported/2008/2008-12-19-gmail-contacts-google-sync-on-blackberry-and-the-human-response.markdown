Okay, I got really excited by [Google Sync for the Blackberry](http://www.google.com/mobile/blackberry/sync.html) when they announced the new feature syncing not just your calendar with your device but also your contacts.

Happy day - I could now exist entirely on Google-Blackberry and they work well together (sort of). Except when I started using the app in my Blackberry, it started mangling my addresses.

I ended up finding a few fun things such as contacts duplicated 3-5 times, some contacts deleted, and my favorite, a contact's address repeated 50-60 times in one entry.[ Other people](http://blogs.zdnet.com/cell-phones/?p=288) also had this problem.

So now my contacts are all jacked up and the only way to deal with them is to go through every @!@$% contact (over 700 right now) and edit them to make sure they are all set. Also, editing contacts in the Gmail page is less than easy or fun to do. I've been looking into exporting everything to CSV, editing in Excel, and reimporting, but I think that still leaves all of my bad contacts intact.

Last complaint - Lots of my contacts are the same person but with two email addresses, however Gmail won't let you have two different contacts with the same email address. This means you have to copy the email address and any other info, delete the second contact, and add the info to the first contact hoping you don't lose it from the clipboard. A simple "combine contacts" feature would save a lot of hassle.

Come on, Gmail. You used to be so solid and made me want to get everyone onboard. Lets keep the innovation coming at a better pace than it has been.

Cute themes are a lot less important than contacts
