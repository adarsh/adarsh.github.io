The KLF are probably remembered as an early-90's techno group that dressed in
cult robes and did a duet with Tammy Wynette. They also were the #1 singles
artist of 1991, adopted esoteric sci-fi novel philosophies, wrote an ironic
book about how to have a #1 hit, defaced billboards, took out cryptic ads in
music magazines, and [videotaped themselves burning a million pounds sterling
on a Scottish
island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_Foundation_Burn_a_Million_Quid). The KLF
retired by performed at a music industry showcase concert which ended by fired
machine-gun blanks into the unsuspecting audience (ok, over the audience) and
left a dead sheep outside the door, after which they announced their retirement
and deleted their entire back catalog. People don't really understand what the
hell they were about, but they were at least interesting.

You, on the other hand, are a coward who writes graffiti in bar bathrooms and
have never accomplished anything. Please go back to scribbling fake website
names with sharpies.
