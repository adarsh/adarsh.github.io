On Tuesday, I was four days into post-op convalescence for having my ACL repaired. Laid up on the couch, immobile, and in constant 6 on a scale of 10 pain with no real indication it was going to improve. I was in a bad mood. And it got worse.

Of course, this was when the Detroit Tigers decided to culminate a potentially dominant season by losing enough games to tie for the division with the Minnesota Twins. As you know, we lost in spectacular fashion over 12 innings. I was flipping out on the couch after watching the lack of run support, defensive gaffes, and leaving Rodney in for a million years. It quickly became worse than the knee pain. In fairness, the Twins outplayed us, but it was yet another game where a Detroit sports team comes close but just short.

This was best summarized by my friend Nirav's email to me that night, subject line "I Hate Hope":

(Note: Bracketed comments mine)

What becomes clear is that the last half decade of sports, we have some
contenders but they rarely convert into real championships in recent history.
To complete the view, the Wings won in 2008, 2002, and 1998, the Pistons won in
2004, 1990, and 1989, and Michigan football won in 1998. If we stretch, we can
get back to 1984 for the World Series Tigers win, and before that, it's a big
drought. This list also mercifully omits the Lions 0-16 season in 2008.

The picture that emerges is one of high and dashed expectations. I've always
joked that Michigan football is taking years off of my life, but the margins of
victory are always slim and decided in the last few minutes. To say it's
straining relationships and stress levels across the country is a vast
understatement. It's tough to watch your teams get to the big stage, get your
hopes up, and then fall short. It's even tougher to watch that happen over and
over, while your local economy dissolves and your friends/family go through the
hardest possible times. Sports can help draw cities together and heal wounds
deeper than you can imagine (see the 1968 Detroit riots and the role the Tigers
played - captured beautifully in HBO's ["City on
Fire"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343535/))

But here's the thing: Detroit is not a city of losers. We have (Lions aside) a
long history of solid sports championships and really dedicated sports fans
(Lions included). What people don't realize is that it's really a football town
that constantly hangs its head. If the Tigers winning the World Series in 1984
led to rioting, the Lions winning the Super Bowl would cause everyone's brains
to explode simultaneously. We are tough fans who expect a lot from our teams
and each other, so disappointment is normal when you expect a lot.

Keep in mind, Michiganders, we are not Philadelphia, who before the Phillies
won in 2008, hadn't had a championship since the Sixers won in 1983. Now
*that's* a drought. We don't have it so bad, sports-wise.
