<p>Continuing my series demystifying consulting,
(which premiered <a href="/how-to-run-a-freelance-software-consulting-business">here</a>)
I&rsquo;m going to share what I know about
closing sales leads.</p>

<h2>Caveat</h2>

<p>As previously stated,
I am not any kind of sales guru
or webinar purveyor.
I&rsquo;m just a guy who has experience
finding fun freelancing work.</p>

<p>If you want to read the classics on sales,
I honestly can&rsquo;t help you - I have no idea what they are,
but <a href="http://amzn.to/1Rw38Ne">Amazon</a> probably does.
(Caution: Sales books are also selling you a book
in addition to advice, so be careful)</p>

<p><em>If you haven&rsquo;t already,
check out
<a href="/how-to-run-a-freelance-software-consulting-business">my original article on how to generate sales leads here</a>.</em></p>

<h2>Okay now I have leads</h2>

<p>Great, so you have a lead!
Wait, what is a &ldquo;lead&rdquo; again?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just a person who has showed some interest
in working with you as a consultant.
No one has made any promises,
and sentences end with phrases like
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if we can figure this out&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Everyone is hopeful and excited (probably).
What you do next is critical:
You have a meeting to discuss the project.</p>

<p>You should meet in person if possible.
Remember your goal is to build trust,
the foundation of any good business relationship.</p>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t do in-person,
videochat to ensure they see
you are a human with a face and feelings.</p>

<h2>The Sales Meeting</h2>

<p>This meeting is a weird one but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be.
Essentially you&rsquo;re trying to say
&ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;d like for you to pay me to do stuff. I&rsquo;m good at what I do.&rdquo;
and the other party is saying
&ldquo;Hey, I have no idea who you are,
please prove to me you are good at your job
and that you can help me solve my problem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So these are your goals
and those should be plainly stated to everyone
RIGHT AT THE START OF THE MEETING.
Something like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Hey thanks for taking this meeting,
I appreciate your time.
How&rsquo;s this agenda sound:
1) I get to know you and your problem/project
2) You get to know me and what I&rsquo;m good at
3) We decide together if there is a fit between the two?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The important message you are conveying here is
&ldquo;I have no idea if it&rsquo;s a good idea to work together.
We should discuss it and see if that is the case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This totally flips people out.
When you are in the Sales Meeting™,
most people expect you to stretch the truth
and be aggressive in pushing your case
because that&rsquo;s what most people do.</p>

<p>If you start with some practical honesty,
you&rsquo;ll immediately garner some trust.
Your discussion will go a lot better
when your lead realizes you&rsquo;re not a greasy weirdo
but just some person looking to find work.</p>

<p>One tip here:
<em>You should get them to talk about their project first.</em>
You are probably good at lots of stuff
and if you go through all of it,
frankly, it will be boring and probably irrelevant.</p>

<p>If you get to hear the project first,
then you can tailor what you share
about your abilities/experience.</p>

<p>If they insist and say &ldquo;no you first&rdquo;,
just tell them you want to tailor the discussion
and not waste their time.
If there&rsquo;s one thing people love,
it&rsquo;s people not wasting their time.</p>

<h2>Have a pitch of some sort</h2>

<p>When you talk about yourself and your work,
be prepared to show what you&rsquo;ve done
and talk about who you worked with.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve signed NDAs,
you should have cleared some anonymized versions of the work
with your previous client before this meeting.</p>

<p>You should also highlight
how you solve problems of this type
and talk about questions that usually come up
when dealing with this kind of work.</p>

<p>You can do this via a portfolio,
or manifesto,
or <a href="http://adarsh.io">blog</a>.</p>

<p>This part of you describing your work
should be prepared, but not rehearsed.</p>

<p>You should practice it 10-15 times on friends
before taking it out on the road for best results.</p>

<p>Also, as you repeat this pitch,
it will evolve and improve over time.
Pay attention to what people respond to
and talk more about those things.</p>

<p>Last note, it should be short, say ~5 minutes.
If there’s one thing people love, it’s people not wasting their time.</p>

<h2>Figure out if there is a fit (AKA &ldquo;turn down almost all of your leads&rdquo;)</h2>

<p>Okay, now you&rsquo;ve heard what they need done
and you have said something about yourself.</p>

<p><strong>At this point, you should probably turn down the work.</strong></p>

<p>In my experience,
you should expect to politely decline about 90% of your leads.</p>

<p>Generally, you shouldn&rsquo;t have to persuade people.
If the sales process feels like a natural fit
so will the project&rsquo;s build phase.</p>

<p>What? Aren&rsquo;t you trying to sell work?</p>

<p>Yes, you are, but odds are,
it&rsquo;s not a good fit for one of the below-discussed reasons.</p>

<p>But more importantly,
the worse of a fit the project is for you,
the worse it will go
and the lower chance of referrals
which means your reputation and business are sinking.</p>

<p>If you take high-quality good-fit projects,
they will beget more of the same.
If you take crappy death-marches,
you&rsquo;ll get more of those.</p>

<p>Okay why is it potentially not a good fit?</p>

<ul>
<li>You don&rsquo;t know how to do what they want</li>
<li>What they want done is probably the wrong way to go about it</li>
</ul>

<p>If it&rsquo;s the former, you should say something like
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to do that, sorry,&rdquo; and leave.
If you know someone else who can do the work,
you should offer an introduction
and thank them for making you
a pourover coffee which took 15 minutes.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t know how to do it
<em>but feel like you could wing it</em>
say that, but then offer a significant discount,
like 50% off for the first few weeks.</p>

<p>If they&rsquo;re going about things all wrong,
there are two flavors:</p>

<h3>1) This is a terrible project for anyone, anywhere</h3>

<p>You need to cautiously figure out a way to share this
without being a know-it-all. Something like</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look, clearly you are a sharp lady and know the world of high finance well, but building a mobile app to run hair salons without any experience might be troublesome.  As I&rsquo;ve seen it in my work, some domain expertise is important
 to success in software businesses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be sure to explain yourself but also note that you could be totally wrong.
Then, be nice, compliment their carpet, and leave quickly.</p>

<h3>2) This is a reasonable project but some specifics are off</h3>

<p>Maybe you feel like there&rsquo;s a better way to do this?
You should share that and say why,
ideally sharing some experience where
you did things your way and it turned out amazingly.</p>

<p>This is the best case situation.
You are an expert and will probably do a much better job
than they expected and everyone will be happy.</p>

<p>At this point, you should close the meeting
and say &ldquo;hey this sounds like it might be a fit&rdquo;
should we find some more time to go through this in detail?&ldquo;</p>

<p>The second meeting will be about project specifics
and pricing.</p>

<h2>Negotiating a Contract</h2>

<p>Again, other smarter people than me
have written more on the subject,
but here&rsquo;s what has worked well for me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only work on time and materials - never fixed bid.</li>
<li>Set a daily or weekly rate, not an hourly one - it keeps clients from
nitpicking how you spend your time.</li>
<li>Agree to invoice once a week and send them Friday evening when you wrap up for
the day. Be very detailed in accounting for your time in the invoice. I like
<a href="https://adarshpandit.freshbooks.com/tryfreshbooks/www">FreshBooks</a> for invoicing but there are lots of good/simple/free choices.</li>
<li>Make the contract week-to-week with an option to stop with 2 weeks notice. It
allows the project to keep going or stop as needed.</li>
<li>Keep proposals and contracts generic.  Don&rsquo;t specify a ton of low level
requirements to be implemented during the project, because they will change.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t sign NDA&rsquo;s if possible. No idea is that amazing, it&rsquo;s execution that
matters. Also, the client won&rsquo;t tell you <em>anything</em> without an NDA, you should
pass.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t respond to RFPs. It takes forever and is usually a sign the client has
overscoped the project.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t take equity. You are not a seasoned investor. Save your cash and put it
in an index fund.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Closing</h2>

<p>Again, without belaboring the point,
be yourself and don&rsquo;t force any agreements or partnerships.
The more natural the sales process feels,
the more likely you will have a good outcome,
good referrals,
and booming business.</p>

<p>Please be sure to invite me out on your boat for a ride.</p>
