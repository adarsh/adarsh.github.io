<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about networking, largely because I&rsquo;m trying to get to
know more folks in a new industry and in a new geography. Becoming familiar
with a totally new universe of companies, trends, people, brands, and media
sources is quite a task in and of itself. </p>

<p>Without belaboring the point, I agree with the old axiom &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not <em>what</em> you
know, its <em>who</em> you know.&rdquo; My friend Greg put it this way &ldquo;Networking is what
you do constantly when you <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> need it, so it&rsquo;s there when you <strong>do</strong>.&rdquo;
Networking is clearly the best way to get a new job, source new business, learn
more about pretty much anything, and I&rsquo;m beginning to suspect it probably helps
the love life. </p>

<p>Okay, so we all agree it&rsquo;s important to do, but what&rsquo;s difficult is actually
doing it. It takes a LOT of energy and time. I&rsquo;ve been to a few industry
networking events recently, and he experience reminded me of middle school
dances. A lot of awkward glances and smiles, some forced chitchat, and lots of
cookies. You have to force yourself into conversations, meet people with whom
you have potentially nothing in common, and hold a conversation for 5 minutes.
Even if you suck, you&rsquo;ll get a business card out of it, which you then have to
connect to your linkedin/doostang/etc acct and email them to make nice. </p>

<p>If you do it right, it&rsquo;s not disingenuine and helps you get to know more folks
in the right places. But its certainly hard work. </p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m not going to tell you networking events, linkedin.com, or just plain
coldcalling is not necessary, because it is. However, I found a good way to
keep contacts warm once you&rsquo;ve made them. I use Google Reader occasionally to
keep up on a few different periodicals I like, especially industry specific
blogs and other random things I&rsquo;m interested in. </p>

<p>Google Reader is great with keyboard shortcuts (much like most GOOG products)
and my favorite one is &ldquo;e&rdquo; which quickly lets you email something interesting
to someone you know. I use it 4-5 times a session and work a little harder to
email people I haven&rsquo;t talked to in a while. The critical part is to keep the
forward relevant to the recipient and to add a note indicating as much to them.</p>

<p>It takes about 30 seconds and the effect is to keep yourself in the forebrain
of people you&rsquo;ve met and help you sell, forge partnerships, and get jobs. Hope
it works for you as well as it&rsquo;s worked for me.</p>
