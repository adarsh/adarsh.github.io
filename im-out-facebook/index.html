<p>I&rsquo;ve been wrestling with this for a while. My wife deactivated her account more
than a year ago and found it refreshing.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t think I was going the same way. However, I realized a year ago how
little I logged in and why.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2>Friends?</h2>

<p>I looked at my feed and realized:</p>

<ol>
<li>More than half of my &lsquo;friends&rsquo; were acquaintainces</li>
<li>I had not contacted ~90% of my &#39;friends&rsquo; in the past year</li>
<li>The content most people posted was not very interesting to me.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Content</h2>

<p>The last one is important. Even if I felt no close connection to the people
posting, if the content was good, I&rsquo;d probably still check it.</p>

<p>Most of it was strongly political, incredibly negative, or wildly inappropriate
(family member passed, very personal medical info, etc).</p>

<h2>Kids</h2>

<p>Being in my (ahem) 30&rsquo;s, most of my &#39;friends&rsquo; had kids, so my wall was a flood
of pictures of children.</p>

<p>As a new dad, I get the desire to constantly share pictures of your kids. I
also get the other side - it can be too much. I&rsquo;ve had a number of friends have
trouble starting a family and I get that perspective also.</p>

<p>Before our son was born, my wife and I agreed not to post pictures on Facebook.
We set up a private password-protected Tumblr and share the link with friends
and family.  I like it because Tumblr (and Tweets/Instagrams) are all more
&#39;opt-in&rsquo; to me - if people don&rsquo;t want to see the content, they can unfollow me
or stop checking the blog.</p>

<p>I recently read a post by someone who made Facebok palatable by unfollowing
everyone but friends/family. I definitely could do it, but it doesn&rsquo;t appeal to
me.</p>

<p>The less I&rsquo;ve used Facebook, the more they have sent me really needy,
passive-aggressive emails to try to get me to log in. If they left me alone,
I&rsquo;d probably just de-friend everyone but my family. But that&rsquo;s not how you run
a business.</p>

<p>So today, for some reason I had enough and deactivated my account. I know all
of the data will stay there in perpetuity, but at least the emails will stop (I
hope).</p>
