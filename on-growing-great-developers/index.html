<h2>You Can Either Steal Great Developers or Farm Them</h2>

<p><em>To grow software development teams, you can either steal excellent developers or you can develop them internally.</em></p>

<p><em>Everyone tries to steal but few invest in farming new developers.  Those who do have lower salary and recruiting costs, better learning cultures, and improved diversity.</em></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s why you would set up an Apprenticeship program and how to do so.</p>

<p>If you want help setting up a program like this, <a href="mailto:hi@cylinder.work?subject=Saw%20Your%20Blog%20Post!%20Can%20you%20Help%20Us%20With%20Our%20Apprenticeship%20Program?">email me</a>!</p>

<h3>Why Steal</h3>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s straightforward. You have a need for help, they have skills you probably need.</li>
<li>You can buy your way out of the problem.</li>
<li>It is how everyone has hired for as long as anyone can remember.</li>
<li>Short-term impact. Expert developers can get ramped up quickly and help you ship much faster.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Farm</h3>

<ul>
<li>Cost - Creating a developer growth pipeline is much cheaper in the long-term. Apprentices are cheaper than experienced developers and will take a salary hit for the learning opportunity.</li>
<li>Loyalty - Apprentices are extremely loyal and less likely to turn over. You
took a chance on them and they will always remember.</li>
<li>Diversity - The experienced developer pool is very homogeneous. The junior pool
is not. If you can turn juniors into seniors, diversity will improve.</li>
<li>Vibe - Apprentices add a lot to company culture. Senior devs love to teach and
coach, so give them a chance to do so. Also, Apprentices have an energy and
optimism the old folks may have lost over the years.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Personal Backstory</h2>

<p>Back in 2012, as I tried to break into the software industry as a developer,
I got a break.
That break was <a href="http://www.apprentice.io?utm_source=adarsh.io&amp;utm_medium=blog">an apprenticeship at a local development consulting firm</a>.
I&rsquo;m still not clear how I got it, but it was amazing.</p>

<p>I made $100/day and worked 8 hours shadowing a developer consultant at a client.
In the evenings, I would stay up late Googling terms
I didn&rsquo;t understand during the day and practicing new techniques on toy apps.
It&rsquo;s made all the difference to my career and I&rsquo;m thankful every day for the
shot.</p>

<p>After getting hired as a full-timer (and later, serving as manager),
I had a chance to interview candidates and see which ones succeeded.</p>

<p>This is what I&rsquo;ve learned about how to successfully run an apprenticeship program.</p>

<h2>What is a Apprentice?</h2>

<ul>
<li>A junior developer with <em>some</em> experience. You will pay this person and train
them for a few months with the goal of hiring them as full-time employees.</li>
<li>They should be able to write and deploy working software, however simple the
app is or rough the code is.</li>
<li>Boot camp grads are usually a good fit. As of this writing, I recommend
<a href="https://www.turing.io?utm_source=adarsh.io&amp;utm_medium=blog">Turing School</a> or <a href="https://devbootcamp.com?utm_source=adarsh.io&amp;utm_medium=blog">DevBootCamp</a>.</li>
<li>Everyone from fresh college grads to mid-career switchers are great
candidates.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How do I Interview Them?</h2>

<h3>Use the same interview process as your full-timers</h3>

<p>Give them the same questions/challenges as your full-timers
but evaluate their responses with this lens:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I coach this person for 3 months,
would their answer meet our expectations for a full-time junior developer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This involves a bit of imagination of what someone&rsquo;s learning vs. time slope
is before you get to work with them.</p>

<h3>What the Heck is a Learning vs. Time Slope?</h3>

<p>Through experience, I have discovered that each person has an internal rate of
learning.
That is, people can accumulate and apply new concepts at a consistent rate.
Imagine it looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/skill_vs_time-1cac86c0.png" alt="Skill_vs_time" width="658" height="403" /></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>For any given candidate their slope will remain constant over time,
given ongoing support. (AKA &ldquo;Pandit&rsquo;s Postulate&rdquo;)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can use this imaginary non-quantifiable slope to both judge if they are good
apprenticeship candidates, and later, if they would be good full-time hires.</p>

<p>The trick here is to use an interview to figure out what the candidate&rsquo;s slope
is. Good ol&rsquo; <code>y = mx + b</code>.</p>

<p>How do you do that? Well, you get two data points, somehow, and solve for <code>m</code>.</p>

<p>You can look at their public code samples noting the dates, and watch
progression. You can also see if their toy applications increase in complexity
over time.</p>

<p>But these are guesses. You can also run an experiment to get the data.</p>

<h3>A Hiring Case Study</h3>

<p>Once upon a time, a designer applied to work with our team.
She was very skilled as a visual designer, working mostly in print/media
at ad agencies.
She was also professional, proactive, and the team really liked her.</p>

<p>The role I was hiring for required front-end skills, which she did not have.
I gave her some homework saying something like
&ldquo;See if you can rebuild your portfolio site using these tools and deploy to
GitHub Pages or Heroku.&rdquo; I gave this homework to lots of non-coding applicants.</p>

<p>She was the only one to ever respond, and just four weeks later.
Now I had two data points: <code>(0,0)</code> and
<code>(4 weeks, learn enough front-end to make a portfolio site)</code>.</p>

<p>Solving for a non-numerical <code>m</code> value,
I guessed she would be ready for full-time work in 3 months.
Turns out, it was 4 months, but her slope kept constant (or improved!). So as a
result, I got a top-notch teammate and culture for a pretty small investment.</p>

<h2>Tactics for Starting Your Apprenticeship Program</h2>

<ul>
<li>Put up a separate landing page which feeds into your full-time hiring
pipeline. Run ads against it or blog/tweet about it.</li>
<li>Select for humility <em>and</em> confidence. You want candidates are willing to take a
step back to learn, regardless of their past work history or accomplishments.</li>
<li>Only take candidates excited about the apprenticeship opportunity. Focus on
people who want to learn/grow. Otherwise you&rsquo;re selling something to a
reluctant buyer.</li>
<li>Respond quickly to applicants! You should do this for other candidates also.
Just sayin&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Develop and document how to screen and mentor apprentices.</li>
<li>Turn down almost all of your candidates at first, to get a feel for who is out there.</li>
<li>Be very clear about it being an apprenticeship. Apprentices may not get a job
at the end, and they&rsquo;ll have to work for it. Be clear about that.</li>
<li>Set a decision point at the end of two months when you make full-time offers.
This gives the candidate time to look for another job.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t have too many apprentices at once. Maybe a ratio of 1:10 or 1:20.</li>
<li>Also, before you even start the program, you should have a few mentors who are
very excited about the program, otherwise you&rsquo;re forcing something on the team
which they may resent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Have retrospectives with everyone (Candidates, Apprentices, Mentors, Everyone
Else) as you go.</li>
<li>Frequently iterate based on the feedback.
Your success metric should be &ldquo;number of great full-time hires made out of the
program.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Make sure candidates get the same experience they&rsquo;d get on the job.
This helps you evaluate the candidate and helps them evaluate you as an
employer.</li>
<li>Try to have more than one participant at a time.
This camraderie is helpful support for a pretty stressful job experience.</li>
<li>Allow candidate to set up their own success criteria
and use it to keep them accountable and measure how they&rsquo;re doing.</li>
<li>Any learning the candidate does should be shared back with the mentor, maybe
in a weekly check-in.</li>
<li>Encourage candidates to network, go to meet ups, etc. Community is part of the job.</li>
</ul>
