<p>As a newcomer to Rails,
understanding Gems and the Gemfile
is fairly straightforward:
You include a gem that you need
and you get it included everywhere.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t often think about it,
but that last bit is important:
we are literally <code>include</code>ing
all of the code from each gem
into our application, all the time.</p>

<p>There are other implications of
this <code>include</code> behavior which should be considered,
like speed
but here I&rsquo;m going to address one:
Gem Drift and the associated cost.</p>

<h2>An Example</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say I include an auth gem called <code>huge_bouncer</code>
in my app to do authentication and authorization.
(Note: this is not a real gem, but a name I love.
Feel free to use it but please attribute here
so I can feel good about my gem-naming skills.)</p>

<p>Over time, the nice person who wrote <code>huge_bouncer</code>
reviews issues and PRs at night and on weekends
and keeps development moving at a good pace.
She is a saint and deserves an award
or at least you should buy her a beer
if you run into her at conference.</p>

<p>Newly released gem versions are, for the most part,
new features and security patches
(particularly in auth libraries).
Not keeping up-to-date with new features
is no big deal in the short term, really.
I mean, yes, they built a nice OAuth DSL
but we don&rsquo;t use that in our app, so who cares.</p>

<p>Not keeping up to date with security patches is a bigger issue.
You know who keeps up with those updates?
<a href="http://www.phrack.org/papers/attacking_ruby_on_rails.html">Bad people who want to target your innocent webapp.</a></p>

<p>You need to keep your app up to date,
so how do you do it?</p>

<h2>Enter Robots</h2>

<p>Anything you need to do routinely
should be automated, right?
You can use <a href="https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit">bundler-audit</a>
to regularly check for <em>reported</em> security fixes.</p>

<p>It works like this:</p>

<p>Add the gem:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="c1"># Gemfile</span>
<span class="c1"># ...</span>
<span class="n">group</span> <span class="ss">:development</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:test</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'bundler-audit'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">require: </span><span class="kp">false</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Then set it up to check for vulnerabilities
when you run the test suite:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="c1"># Rakefile</span>
<span class="c1"># ...</span>
<span class="n">task</span> <span class="ss">default: </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:spec</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">task</span> <span class="ss">default: </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'bundler:audit'</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre><pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="c1"># lib/tasks/bundler_audit.rake</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="no">Rails</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">env</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">development?</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="no">Rails</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">env</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">test?</span>
  <span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'bundler/audit/cli'</span>

  <span class="n">namespace</span> <span class="ss">:bundler</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">desc</span> <span class="s1">'Updates the ruby-advisory-db and runs audit'</span>
    <span class="n">task</span> <span class="ss">:audit</span> <span class="k">do</span>
      <span class="sx">%w(update check)</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">command</span><span class="o">|</span>
        <span class="no">Bundler</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Audit</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">CLI</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">start</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">command</span><span class="p">]</span>
      <span class="k">end</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Be sure to <a href="/automatically-check-gem-vulnerabilities-in-circle-ci">add it to your CI as well</a>.</p>

<p>Note there are <a href="https://appcanary.com/">all sorts</a> of nice
<a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/lpg/">paid services</a> which also do
this kind of thing.</p>

<p>Great! We&rsquo;re covered, right?</p>

<p>Sorta. This will check the database
of <em>reported</em> security issues
which is some subset of released security patches.
I don&rsquo;t blame gem maintainers for this:
again, they&rsquo;re working in their spare time
for the greater good.
Expecting them to keep up to date
with more admin activities
isn&rsquo;t really fair.</p>

<p>So what can we do?</p>

<h2>A Path Forward</h2>

<p>I started doing something on projects recently
which colleagues either don&rsquo;t care about
or appreciate me doing:</p>

<p>Monday morning,
I take 15 minutes
and run <code>bundle update</code>.</p>

<p>Then I open a PR with the changes,
and hopefully deploy within the hour
once I get code review.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>The changes are very often quite minor
and when they&rsquo;re not,
I look at the gem&rsquo;s release notes
and figure out what the changes are.
If it&rsquo;s a big change,
say new deprecations or
breaking changes,
I fix them in about 30 minutes.
People are pretty good about <a href="http://semver.org/">SemVer</a>.</p>

<p>Remember software is best changed
in small iterations,
and updating gems
is still shipping software changes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;HAHA, oh great plan but we are <em>way</em> out of date already and can&rsquo;t just jump right up to current.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course. So here&rsquo;s what you do:
Go into the lockfile (<code>Gemfile.lock</code>)
and figure out what the specific versions
are of things which are really far out of date.
For example, let&rsquo;s say <code>huge_bouncer</code>
is now at version 2.0.7,
but we don&rsquo;t know what we are locked at:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="c1"># Gemfile.lock</span>
<span class="c1"># ...</span>
  <span class="n">huge_bouncer</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">bcrypt</span>
    <span class="n">email_validator</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">~&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">rails</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>We can use the <a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/rubys-pessimistic-operator">twiddle-waka</a> operator to say
&ldquo;when updating this gem,
only do so to the next major version,&rdquo;
like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="c1"># Gemfile</span>
<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'huge_bouncer'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'~&gt; 1.2.4'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Okay so now we are not moving that much,
and can do a safe <code>bundle_update</code>
without moving the versions too much.
In this case, let&rsquo;s say we get up to 1.2.8.
This is an improvement!</p>

<p>Then, when we next have time,
we can loosen the restrictions a bit,
<code>bundle update</code> again,
and see if all is okay.</p>

<p>Remember, we want to make and deploy
small changes, so don&rsquo;t get all crazy.</p>

<h2>Wait, What About Robots Again?</h2>

<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t you build or pay for some service
which does this for you?</p>

<p><em>NO</em>.</p>

<p>You are including a heck-ton of other code
and you should be aware of
how it is changing.
Maybe not in minute detail,
but it&rsquo;s a lot of code
which you are shipping,
so you should read the label.</p>

<h2>The Money Saved</h2>

<p>No one will care if you update gems
every Monday morning
but you are saving your company
lots of money.</p>

<p>I asked some friends
to estimate the cost of
getting totally current with their gems
at their company or clients
and here&rsquo;s what they said:</p>

<ul>
<li>Upgrading Rails 2 to 3 is about 16+
developer-weeks, so about a $100-200k problem</li>
<li>Upgrading Rails 3 to 4 is about half of that.</li>
</ul>

<p>Assume the bigger the codebase,
or the older it is,
the higher the cost.</p>

<p>So no, it&rsquo;s not glamorous work
but someone should thank you for doing it.</p>

<p>Also, if you are up to date,
others will pick up the slack for you
<em>because you&rsquo;ve made it so easy</em>.
Good job! You are a minor hero!</p>

<p>Big thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/drapergeek">Jason Draper</a>
for helpful edits
and promising to argue with me about this
in public.</p>

<p>Also, thanks to the people who
shared estimates or anecdotes
of what it costs to upgrade
Gem suites.</p>
