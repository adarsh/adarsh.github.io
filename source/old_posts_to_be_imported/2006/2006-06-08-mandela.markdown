Instead of doing a solid job describing the country of South Africa, I'll drop some photos representative of how fucked up people get when you institutionally implement racism.   
  
For example, at one of the nicest restaurants in Capetown, for some reason, this dude in a Mandela mask comes in and freaks everyone the fuck out. Just to clarify, the other two people who came to our table to "entertain" us were a belly dancer and a coked-up cigar girl.
