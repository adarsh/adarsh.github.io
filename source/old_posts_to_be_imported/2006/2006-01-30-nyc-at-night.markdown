I met my future employers and coworkers this weekend in New York. Some observations on my assimilation into the corporate world and New York:  
  
- I bought a rolly suitcase. It actually is much easier to get around with than any other type of luggage, even if you do look like a tool.  
  
- The lack of smoking in NYC bars is fantastic. And as annoying as seems, clubs which maintain male/female ratios are much more fun to be in than those in Chicago.   
  
- Future consultants use "value proposition" constantly and excessively.
