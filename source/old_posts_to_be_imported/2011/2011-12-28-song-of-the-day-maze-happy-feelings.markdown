It's the holiday-times so I'm going with some of my more favorite good-mood relaxing tracks. This one in particular was played for me by a friend while we were on an amazing vacation earlier in the year, certainly one of the highlights of 2011 for me.

This one is from [Maze](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IBRbzf3Fws), one of Marvin Gaye's opening acts who released [this classic album in 1977](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00022FWKE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=whmomyth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00022FWKE). They're more well known for "[Joy and Pain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQhZSyXUUX8)", or rather, for when [Rob Base sampled it wholesale for a song of the same name](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bXmMjrYwe4). Not that I begrudge Mr. Base - he's living well on "[It Takes Two](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IBRbzf3Fws)" downloads sold during weddings after some white zin.
