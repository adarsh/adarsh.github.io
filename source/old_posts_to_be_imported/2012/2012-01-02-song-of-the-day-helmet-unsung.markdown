Yes fine - a lot of these are clearly from my formative musical days in the mid-90's. I'm going to go with it until I run out of songs and make a sincere effort to post more recent stuff in the future. 2012 resolution or whatnot.

To create a zig for yesterday's sweet-tuned zag, today's song is angry. Rather, it's the only album I listen to when I'm interested in listening to angry music, which thankfully is rare these days. From Helmet's "Meantime" album from 1992 (which is solid all the way through), I picked "Unsung", the only single from the record. It was a toss-up for me between this one and "[In the Meantime [youtube]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgGyX7WPxuQ)", which is just a fireball and also worth a listen as well.

Some back-story, famous-person [Steve Albini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini) recorded this record shortly after "[Nevermind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevermind)", which was also mixed by the great [Andy Wallace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Wallace_(producer)). They did not get along:


The song "In the Meantime" was recorded by [Steve Albini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini) and later remixed by [Andy Wallace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Wallace_(producer)). The contrast between Wallace's style of mixing, which involves (among other things) triggered samples (leading to the album's distinctive half wood, half metal [snare drum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snare_drum) sound), and Albini's style of recording, irritated Albini. Later, when in negotiations to record[Nirvana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band))'s _[In Utero (album)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Utero_(album))_, he stipulated a clause be added to his contract stating that Wallace would not be allowed to remix the album, although he had mixed _[Nevermind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevermind)_, which came out a year before _Meantime'_s release. [[From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meantime_(album))]


It's hard to know what to make of this sort of thing. It always colors your experience somewhat. For example, I think this record is perfect, but to know the people who made it had problems with it is a downer. Kind of like Eddie Murphy talking about how [much he and John Landis hated each other](http://collider.com/entertainment/archive_detail.asp?aid=813&cid=1&tcid=1) during "[Coming to America](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305310343/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&tag=whmomyth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=6305310343)". Maybe it's better not to know so much about the art we consume. Thanks a lot, The Internet.
