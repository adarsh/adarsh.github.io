This is a "band" called Sid Maudlin, maybe it's the woman's name. Essentially it's a Goth/Industrial version of Britney Spears, complete with dancers. The even weirder thing (?) is that all of the friends who came to see her perform were Lincoln Park Trixies and their associated fratboyfriends. Totally weird.
