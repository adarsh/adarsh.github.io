I am about to leave for Europe. In line with me at the check-in desk is a large group of loud eurotrash Italians. Two of them look like Yanni. Also there is a group going to Jamaica and they all have smiles on their faces.




The Air-India desk is staffed with white people. Everyone in line has about 5 times their own weight in luggage. Why can my people not pack? Also, traditional Indian clothes are not designed for Chicago winters.




I hope there is a bar in the gate area.
