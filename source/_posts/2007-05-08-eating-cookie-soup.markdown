It's like having Oreo cookies with milk, only you just say fuck it and go the whole way. Be warned: this is only for serious sugarheads. The recipe is:

- Several Oreo cookies
- Bowl
- Spoon
- Milk (whole is best)

Combine ingredients and let sit for 5 mins. Cookies will get soggy and you will get mushy Oreos and chocolate flake-infused milk solution.

According to it's creator, it's more efficient and less messy than the traditional dunking method. I have to say, it's pretty good, and I don't usually like sweets. Give it a whirl and post your reviews below.
