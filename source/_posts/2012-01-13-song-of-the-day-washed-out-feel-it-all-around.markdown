New favorite song/band discovered as the theme song for Fred Armisen and Carrie
Brownstein's "Portlandia"[[New Yorker Review of
S2](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/01/02/120102fa_fact_talbot)], which
is a hipster show which makes fun of hipsters. Also, it's funny.

I'm a sucker for sentimental music, which this certainly is. It reminds me of
[Boards of
Canada](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AP2ZQC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=whmomyth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000AP2ZQC)
in a way (Great retro video for
"[ROYGBIV](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yT0gRc2c2wQ)"). Or the more obscure
"[Casino vs.
Japan](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006G9ZN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=whmomyth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00006G9ZN)"
(their amazing "Aquarium"

Anyhow, enjoy.  Washed Out - "Feel it all around"
