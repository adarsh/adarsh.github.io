[![](http://activationenergy.files.wordpress.com/2007/02/img_5507.jpg?w=300)](http://activationenergy.files.wordpress.com/2007/02/img_5507.jpg)I got a slice of pizza yesterday at Ben's Pizza. It was severely average. What was not severely average was the sequence of framed, hand-drawn murals hanging on the wall. My favorite was this one, titled "Awesome 80's" and if you click for the zoom, you'll see in the center bottom the artist's signature (and self-portrait) reading "With love from me to you, Rico Fonseca. May 3, 1985".

It's pretty amazing if you have a close look. Something about an 80's mural made in the middle of the decade makes me happy.
