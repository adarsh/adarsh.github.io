This is the Snoqualmie Falls, also known as the backdrop for the opening scene of "Twin Peaks". It's beautiful and made me weirded out that BOB might be around the corner, so I quickly took pictures and left. I spent the rest of the day indoors as it was raining cats and dogs. Nothing exciting, really, just some cards and reading.

I'm running out of stuff to do that's indoors and kind of feeling homesick. I'm leaving early on Saturday and tomorrow night is going to be the big "Last night in town" fest which will involve much barhopping. Stay tuned.
