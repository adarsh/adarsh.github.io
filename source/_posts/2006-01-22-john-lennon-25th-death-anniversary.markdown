I happened to be in New York in December for the 25th anniversary of Lennon's shooting outside his apartment building on the Upper West Side. I walked over and the whole area was a mob scene - TV cameras and vans from across the world, people with guitars singing, making speeches. Nearby in Central Park, in an area designated "Strawberry Fields" in honor of Lennon by the city, a huge crowd with candles was singing Beatles classics, notably "Give Peace a Chance". It was kind of cool to be there, but also sort of a circus. [![Posted by Picasa](http://photos1.blogger.com/pbp.gif)](http://picasa.google.com/)
