Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, and Ronnie DeVoe split off of [New Edition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Edition) in 1989, after it more or less ran its course as [boy bands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_band) from Boston do. (Yes, they're from Boston's Orchard Park housing projects and were formed by the same manager immediately before [NKOTB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Kids_on_the_Block), which was meant to be New Edition but with white teenagers. New Edition, in turn, was meant to be "the New Edition of [The Jackson 5](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001A9Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=whmomyth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000001A9Y)". And the wheel turns.)

Bobby Brown was off doing [songs for the Ghostbuster's II soundtrack](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhoU7lINYxk) (he was voted out of the band in 1986 for "lewd stage acts") and [Ralph Tresvant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Tresvant) failed to fill his shoes as a performer, so they broke up the band in 1989. So legendary producers [Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Jam_%26_Terry_Lewis), most famous for Janet's "[Control](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002GFE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=whmomyth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000002GFE)" and "[Rhythm Nation](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002GFN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=whmomyth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000002GFN)" albums, who produced New Edition as they shifted from bubblegum nonsense to young-adults-with-relationship-problems, smartly managed the offshoot solo acts of BBD and Tresvant.

So [BBD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Biv_DeVoe) released "Poison" in 1989 to huge sales. The music video era was peaking and BBD took advantage with stylish proto-90's fashion (think overalls with one strap) suggestive but not explicit content, and incredible beats (produced by the same geniuses who made Public Enemy's records, [the Bomb Squad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bomb_Squad)). They seemed like cool guys and the songs are still absurdly catchy (Case in point: I insisted "Poison" be played at my wedding and the place went bananas). BBD struck the delicate balance of making R&B that wasn't corny or overly mushy and still had a solid beat.

The album is built like an album - intended to be listened to all the way through, maybe more than once, so there are a lot of solid cuts aside from the singles. One of which is my favorite - "I Thought it Was Me". For all the male bragadoccio of the other songs, this is the one which reveals a slight amount of emotional complexity. This is the album version - the remixes are terrible and the live versions lose the power of the production.
