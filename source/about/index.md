I am a Ruby on Rails developer at [thoughtbot][2].

I trained as scientist and worked as a management consultant for McKinsey
among other firms until vowing to never use PowerPoint again.

A graduate of the [apprentice.io][1] program, I hold a B.S. in Biochemistry from
the University of Michigan and a Ph.D in Biophysics from the University of
Chicago.

I can be found listening to 90's hiphop, cycling, playing poker, watching
football, or eating at Chipotle.
