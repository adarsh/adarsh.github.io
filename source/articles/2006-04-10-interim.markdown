No posts for a while as I've been doing not a lot of anything. The first weekend I got back all of my friends from college came for a buddy's 30th. This is the second time I've had a ton of houseguests (10 this time) and I really can't get enough. It's nice to see people coming into themselves more and more as the years pass. Since then, I've been cleaning the house and watching an inordinant amount of TV. Next week I'm going to spoil my nephew and then take some more vacations later.
