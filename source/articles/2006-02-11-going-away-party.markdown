My boss threw me a going away party last night at his house. We came up with the idea to have an iPod playlist competition. Each person got five songs and a theme. They were alternately awful, hilarious, touching, and insulting. I was sort of getting sentimental, saying goodbye to people I've worked with for over six years. My boss gave me a great speech and gift and I nearly lost it completely. We went out for drinks afterwards and I was really lost in the reality that I'll never work in the lab again. It's been a long time coming, and it's really for the best, and I'm glad to be done, but man, its hard to say goodbye sometimes.
