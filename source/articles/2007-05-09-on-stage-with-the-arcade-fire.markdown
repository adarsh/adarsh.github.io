In short, it was amazing - they put on a great show and are very pro-fans. During the encore, they played "Wake Up" after inviting all of the fans in the front onstage (including me and my pals). To quote my friend Matt, "It's always a good day when you end it up on stage dancing with a band."

The venue is amazing and the restoration job is incredible. If you get the chance to see a show there or just visit, definitely do so.
