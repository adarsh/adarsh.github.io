Interesting blog post on the question of the day: [Will you be Detroit or
Pittsburgh](http://www.lazerow.com/2009/01/will-you-be-pittsburgh-or-will-you-be-detroit.html)? 

The analogy has been made a bunch of times, notably [by the New York Times in
November](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/weekinreview/23streitfeld.html).
The analogy goes something like this: The steel industry is another heavy
capital-intensive business with little room for change and only once they faced
complete bankruptcy were they able to restructure and run profitably. 

This blog post describes how Pittsburgh moved from 10% to less than 1% of the
workforce in the steel industry:

To be sure, Pittsburgh reinvented itself during a run of prosperity. It didn't
happen overnight and it didn't happen without a tremendous amount of federal,
state and local support and vision. Skilled workers who couldn't make a living
in Pittsburgh moved elsewhere, to thriving cities like Phoenix and Vegas."

All good things to do for any city and Ann Arbor is the most likely place for
this to succeed. However, there is a big difference between the steel and auto
industries: cars are not commodities. To make a car, you need many more skilled
creative and technical workers to design, architect, and sell the cars. It's a
different industry and other than the big decline and the high capital
required, it's quite different. 

The big advantage that Detroit has is an abundance of these skilled technical
workers who are now likely to work for a lot less money in a place with a
pretty low cost of living already, laying fertile ground for Detroit to become
the next cleantech hub. 

Some argue, like the [WSJ that there isn't any inherent need for an American
auto industry](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122809320261867867.html), which
is a fair criticism. However, if the auto industry goes down, the effects will
be felt throughout the country and would prove disastrous for our economy
largely. Which is not to say it's okay to bail them out (I'm on the fence on
this issue), but rather the consequences of failure are pretty drastic.
