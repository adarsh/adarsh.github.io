So much like my feelings about Kanye West, I can't stand The Sports Guy personally largely as an extension of my hatred for Boston sports generally and his inability to contain how cool he thinks he is. However, his writing is solid and occasionally writes something I enjoy as seen in this week's column.

Preface: I was watching football last week and almost choked on snack foods when the NBC in-studio commentator was revealed to be Matt Millen for the day. I spazzed out and wrote a bunch of angry texts then proceeded to listen to him for some reason. This more or less captures my reaction.
