[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5119/270/320/IMG_3302.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5119/270/640/IMG_3302.jpg) The weekend was made whole by two people - Greg and Kevin. Greg is this insane naturalist who was maybe the definition of "extreme" and Kevin was the topic of conversation for the whole weekend. Sorry for the shortness, but it's time to see the city of Seattle.
