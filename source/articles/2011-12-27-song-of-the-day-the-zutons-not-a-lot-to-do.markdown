When I used to have a porch, [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSGvu_j2iNM)
was my favorite song to play when sitting out there with a lemonade, watching
shady people walk through the alley.

From the album ["Who Killed the
Zutons?"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00064ADWU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=whmomyth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00064ADWU)
which features horns, like everything they do, and frankly it's hard to dislike
a band with a horn section. Anyhow, enjoy.
