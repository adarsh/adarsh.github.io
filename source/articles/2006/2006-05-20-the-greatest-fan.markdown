I was doing my normal Google Reader roundup of ESPN articles, nerdy computer crap, and local Detroit news when I stumbled across [this article](http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-clipfan12may12,0,1600418.story?coll=la-headlines-sports) about a Clippers fan. Okay, it's weird already - who would really want to watch the Clippers other than anti-Kobe/Phil LA residents. Carl Cook - auto detailer, car washer, laundromat resident, homeless man, Clippers season ticket holder. Cook makes $10,000 or less a year, doesn't have a home, and spends a third of that money on basketball tickets.

When people talk about fans its important to remember that the word is a contraction of "fanatic", which I'm pretty sure was first applied to religious zealots. We've all noticed a solid decline in religiosity among most people, replaced by something called "spirituality", which I think is just the lack of commitment to agnosticism. And I'm sure religion as a whole in the country is on the decline as well.

What's interesting is the replacement of religion with other forms of devotion, such as the homeless Clippers fan, Klingon Speakers, or 24 addicts. What do we call Â regular attendance at an event coupled with unflagging faith in the prime people involved but a religion? Don't we watch certain teams or shows "religiously"? Can it really be there is a part of the human psyche that needs to have faith, be it in something unprovable like God or something completely unlikely such as a Lions playoff game? I suppose if we have no hope or faith in anything, theres no point in going on.
