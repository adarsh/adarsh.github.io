Definitely an interesting place. If you spend most of your time away from the
Red Light district and actually try to hang out with the Dutch, you'll find
that

1. They are happy to get you where your going but
2. Don't wish to converse with you if you're not Dutch and
3. The food sucks.

Aside from that, the place is a liberal wet dream - bicycles have the same
rights as cars, there is free repair everywhere, social programs abound,
everyone seems pretty happy and well adjusted and people don't sweat details
too much. They're pretty chilled out folks in general and seem to worry about
the important things.

Although sometimes I wonder if they're not so "left they become right", as in
the limited number of ATM's in town, which I suspect is designed to curb
spending. Anyhow, there is good ethnic food and it was great to see my friends
who have been living there for over a year now.

Something no one ever seems to mention is that the city itself is very
beautiful, especially the canals and also especially at night. Well worth a
visit.

not see green fairies, that's only if its made wrong. You feel tipsy and
slightly alert - same effect as Irish Coffee.)
